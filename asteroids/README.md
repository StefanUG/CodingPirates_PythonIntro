# Step by step

- 1 Create Screen
- 1 Create Player
- 2-3 Make player move with events
- 4 Make the spaceship shoot with one bullet
- 5 Prevent player from exiting the screen (or appearing in the other side)
- 6 Add a lifetime to the bullets, and make them move across screens too
- 7 Add more bullets, but oops, they are too rapidly firing
- 8 Let's add a Player class and a cooldown/reload time
- 9 Add asteroids
- 10 shoot the asteroids
- 11 why are the bullets not passing on?
- 12 game over if hitting the asteroids
- 13 add score and display it
- 14 Make the asteroids move
- 15 Respawn asteroids
- 16 add health and a grace period after being hit
- 17 add a grace period after being hit

More advanced
- add acceleration to the movement, and keep the ship moving
- break down asteroids when they are shot
- make custom shapes for ship and a moving/accelerating ship
- make custom shapes for asteroids
- make random shapes for asteroids
- make the asteroids rotate as they move
- make the ship follow the mouse pointer and click to shoot
- make explosion animations



## Inspiration

The best implementation of the game so far:

[Asteroid_Turtles by BL-Lee](https://github.com/BL-Lee/Asteroid_Turtles/blob/master/Asteroids.py)

Though the resulting game is not great, there are some great ideas in it, like random asteroid shapes adn explosions.
