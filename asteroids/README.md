# Step by step

- Create Screen
- Create Player
- Make player move with events
- Make the spaceship shoot with one bullet
- Prevent player from exiting the screen (or appearing in the other side)
- Add asteroids
- shoot the asteroids
- game over if hitting the asteroids
- add score and display it
- Make the asteroids move
- Make the spaceship shoot more than one bullet
- Respawn asteroids

More advanced
- add acceleration to the movement, and keep the ship moving
- break down asteroids when they are shot
- add health and a grace period after being hit
- make custom shapes for ship and a moving/accelerating ship
- make custom shapes for asteroids
- make random shapes for asteroids
- make the asteroids rotate as they move
- make the ship follow the mouse pointer and click to shoot
- make explosion animations



## Inspiration

The best implementation of the game so far:

[Asteroid_Turtles by BL-Lee](https://github.com/BL-Lee/Asteroid_Turtles/blob/master/Asteroids.py)

Though the resulting game is not great, there are some great ideas in it, like random asteroid shapes adn explosions.
